== Who Wrote It

This is a pet project modeled after the twitter clone from Michael Hartl's Ruby On Rails Tutorial. 

* Base on an text search exercise in Peter Cooper's Beginning Ruby, the end goal is to create a little quiz that pulls non-random texts from classical texts and have users guess the author.
